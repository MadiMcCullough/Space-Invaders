# Weirdmageddon
A Gravity Falls themed Space Invader- type game where the player can shoot Bill Cipher with Nyan Cat. 

## Description
This code will create a game that resembles a shoot 'em up video game like *Space Invaders*. *Space Invaders* from 1978 was an impactful game that bolstered the action game genre, and remains memorable to today. 

The theme is centered around Disney's show *Gravity Falls* by Alex Hirsch. The show was very impactful for the children that grew up watching it and has inspired many artists to pursue a career in animation. 

## Features
- Bill Ciphers that can move. 
	- Implement a code similarly used for Pong but change the designs to be Space themed characters.
- SFX
	- Make particles for when an Bill is hit. Use aspects of the rain code to make particles.
- Opening screen that introduces the game. Or a points counter. 
	- Use code to make the introduction image appear before the game starts. 

## Challenges
- add sound effects for the game. 
- turning the pong shapes into characters. 
- implementing an opening title card

## Outcomes
